                    <p>"There are never going to be the right words to describe what you mean to me!" Hehe. You've always had my back for the longest time and in spite of every frustration, worry, and THOSE F THINGS that I've come to you about we've always had the best time building a product from all of those conversations. Love you dude. Happy birthday!</p>

                        Well it's been somewhat of a long ride (not a bike ride though). There is one thing in this world that exists and two things that do not exist. The first existence is that of thought. Thought is something that is infinitely expanding as the electricity in your cells spark and reach a greater state of plane. Thought is one of the most beautiful things as it leads to communication which is pivotal to relationships of all sorts. The first non-existence is that of truth. Truth is something that is fun to have but also at the same time something that can hinder the mind when applied poorly. The search for truth is something to not be denied but the achieval of truth must certainly be questioned. The second non-existence is that of the Bianchi sweatshirt. It is a corporeal thing that evades the mind and physical plane whenever encountered. One day maybe this great beast will be encountered. To end with my thesis, the one piece is real, but that's because you are in one piece, therefore you are real.<br>
                        From,<br>

                    <p>Happy birthday Nick! You're a real character haha, it's crazy how the first thing you said to me was "do you play Minecraft?? Let's get on my server tonight!" and now we live together lmao. It's been such a great privilege to be one of your close friends for the past few years, and you're 20 now so ok wow. I hope your bday is so awesome, and that you know I always got your back (even though I catch you helping me out a lot more than I can help you out haha). All that said, words can't really describe how much you mean to me and how much I value your brotherhood man. Love you more than you know. Also... :/</p>
